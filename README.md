# Machine-Learning
Here is the implementation of some of the machine learning algorithms using Octave.
The reason they are implemented in Octave is that so you don't have to deal with the coding and matricies.
You can run the algorithms on both Octave or Matlab and the there's a script in each helping you to go through what the algorithm is doing
